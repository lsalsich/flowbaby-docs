## [0.5.1] - 2025-11-28

### Changed - Plan 043: Tool Descriptions and UX Improvements

**Agent Integration & UX Polish Release** - Enhances tool descriptions for better agent behavior and improves user experience.

#### Enhanced Tool Descriptions (Milestone 1)
- **Updated**: `flowbaby_storeMemory` and `flowbaby_retrieveMemory` tools now include comprehensive, structured instructions (~1,800 characters each) that encode the full Flowbaby memory contract
- **Benefit**: Agents automatically understand when, how, and what to store/retrieve without requiring custom `.agent.md` files
- **Content**: Descriptions include guidance on timing, query construction, what to capture, retrieval limits, and structure guidance

#### Configurable Success Notifications (Milestone 2)
- **New Setting**: `flowbaby.notifications.showIngestionSuccess` (default: `true`)
- **Behavior**: When `false`, suppresses success toast notifications ("Memory staged...", "Flowbaby finished...") while preserving all error notifications
- **Use Case**: Power users who find frequent success toasts distracting can disable them while still receiving critical error alerts

#### Keyboard Shortcut Change (Milestone 3)
- **Changed**: Default capture shortcut from `Ctrl+Alt+C` / `Cmd+Alt+C` to `Ctrl+Alt+F` / `Cmd+Alt+F`
- **Rationale**: Avoids potential conflicts with other extensions and common VS Code operations
- **Migration**: Users with custom keybindings should update to the new shortcut

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with new keyboard shortcut references
- Added `flowbaby.notifications.showIngestionSuccess` to Configuration table
- Updated walkthrough step to reflect new shortcut

## [0.5.0] - 2025-11-28

### Changed - Plan 042: Comprehensive Lint Cleanup

**Code Quality Release** - Establishes consistent code quality standards across TypeScript, Python, and Markdown.

#### TypeScript ESLint (Milestone 1-5)
- **Resolved**: All 272 ESLint violations (12 errors, 260 warnings → 0 errors, 0 warnings)
- **Updated**: ESLint naming-convention rules to allow snake_case for Python bridge JSON contracts
- **Fixed**: 9 `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` by adding proper type definitions
- **Fixed**: 9 `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` by removing/prefixing unused variables
- **Fixed**: 3 `@typescript-eslint/no-var-requires` by converting to ES module imports
- **Auto-fixed**: 47 curly braces and useless escape warnings

#### Python Linting (Milestone 6)
- **Added**: `ruff` linter for Python bridge code (`requirements-dev.txt`)
- **Created**: `extension/bridge/ruff.toml` configuration
- **Resolved**: All Python lint errors (1322 → 0)
- **Added**: `npm run lint:python` script

#### Markdown Linting (Milestone 7)
- **Updated**: `.markdownlint.json` with appropriate rule exceptions
- **Verified**: Zero markdownlint errors on user-facing documentation
- **Added**: `npm run lint:markdown` script

### Developer Experience
- **New**: `npm run lint:all` - Comprehensive lint check (TypeScript + Python + Markdown)
- **New**: `npm run lint:python` - Bridge code linting with ruff
- **New**: `npm run lint:markdown` - User-facing doc linting
- **New**: `.github/workflows/lint.yml` - CI lint enforcement on push/PR

## [0.4.9]

### Fixed - Plan 041: Capture Command UX Fixes

**UX Improvement Release** - Improves the `Ctrl+Alt+C` (Cmd+Alt+C on Mac) capture workflow for intuitive behavior.

#### Editor Selection Prioritization
- **Fixed**: `Ctrl+Alt+C` capture command now correctly uses highlighted text from the active editor
- **Behavior**: When text is selected in the editor, the input box pre-fills with that selection
- **Benefit**: Users can capture highlighted code or notes directly without manual copying

#### Cancellation Logic Fix
- **Fixed**: Pressing Escape now properly cancels the capture operation
- **Previous**: Escape would fall back to clipboard content, causing unintended captures
- **Now**: Escape shows "Capture cancelled" message and aborts without any ingestion

#### Clipboard Fallback (Power User Feature)
- **Preserved**: Submitting an empty input box (Enter with no text) still reads from clipboard
- **Use Case**: Power users can copy content to clipboard, press `Ctrl+Alt+C`, then Enter to capture

#### Content Source Transparency
- **Improved**: Output channel now logs the source of captured content:
  - "Capturing from Editor Selection (X chars)"
  - "Capturing from User Input (X chars)"
  - "Capturing from Clipboard (X chars)"
- **Benefit**: Users can verify what content was actually captured via Output > Flowbaby

#### Empty-All-Sources Handling
- **Added**: When no selection exists, input is empty, and clipboard is empty, shows "Nothing to capture" info message
- **Benefit**: Clear feedback instead of silent failure when there's nothing to capture

## [0.4.8]

### Fixed - Plan 040.1: First-Time Initialization Hotfix

**Critical Hotfix** - Resolves first-time workspace initialization failure introduced in v0.4.7 that required window reload.

#### FlowbabyClient Recreation After Environment Setup (M1)
- **Bug**: Fresh workspaces showed "No module named 'cognee'" error after clicking "Initialize" because FlowbabyClient was created at activation time with system Python before venv existed
- **Root Cause**: When `createEnvironment()` succeeded, the existing client retained its stale `pythonPath: "python3"` instead of detecting the newly-created `.flowbaby/venv`
- **Fix**: Recreate FlowbabyClient after successful environment creation to detect the new venv Python interpreter
- **Benefit**: Users can now use `@flowbaby` immediately after initialization without any window reload

#### Initialization Timeout Fix (M1.1)
- **Bug**: First-run database creation could timeout on slower machines because `initialize()` used the default 10-second timeout
- **Fix**: Increased `init.py` timeout from 10 seconds to 60 seconds
- **Benefit**: First-run initialization (SQLite, Kuzu, LanceDB setup) completes successfully on slower systems

#### Initialization Logging (M2, M3)
- Added detailed progress logging throughout the initialization flow:
  - `[Plan 040] Starting workspace initialization...`
  - `[Setup] Virtual environment created successfully.`
  - `[Setup] Starting dependency installation...`
  - `[Setup] Dependency installation complete.`
  - `[Plan 040] ✅ Environment created successfully`
  - `[Plan 040] Recreating FlowbabyClient with new environment...`
  - `[Plan 040] ✅ Flowbaby client initialized successfully`
- **Benefit**: Users and support can trace initialization issues via Output > Flowbaby channel

### User Experience Improvements
- **No-reload workflow**: First-time initialization now completes in a single process
- **Clear progress**: Setup notifications show venv creation → dependency install → database init
- **Error transparency**: Detailed logging aids troubleshooting when issues occur

## [0.4.7]

### Fixed - Plan 040: Initialization JSON Errors and No-Reload Workflow

**User Experience Release** - Enables frictionless first-run experience by fixing JSON parse errors, eliminating window reloads, and providing clearer health status messaging.

#### M1: Fix `init.py` Stdout Pollution (Critical)
- **Bug**: The cognee SDK prints "User X has registered" and other messages to stdout during database initialization, corrupting the JSON output and causing `JSON.parse()` failures in the TypeScript client
- **Root Cause**: `create_db_and_tables()`, `get_graph_engine()`, and other cognee operations print directly to stdout
- **Fix**: Added `suppress_stdout()` context manager that captures all stdout/stderr during cognee operations and redirects to file logger
- **Contract**: `init.py` now emits exactly one JSON line to stdout and nothing else

#### M2: Chain `flowbabyClient.initialize()` After Environment Setup
- **Bug**: The "Initialize Workspace" command only created the venv but did not initialize the Flowbaby client, forcing users to reload the window
- **Fix**: After successful environment creation, the command now chains into `flowbabyClient.initialize()`, sets `clientInitialized = true`, and registers all providers/tools
- **Benefit**: Users can immediately use `@flowbaby` after clicking "Initialize" without any page reload
- **Added**: Structured error handling with user-facing notifications and Output channel logging for initialization failures

#### M3: Unify Health Check Logic for Fresh Workspaces
- **Bug**: Fresh workspaces with only `.flowbaby/logs` directory were incorrectly marked as "BROKEN" instead of "FRESH"
- **Root Cause**: `checkWorkspaceHealth()` returned `BROKEN` if `.flowbaby` existed but `bridge-env.json` was missing
- **Fix**: Missing `bridge-env.json` now correctly returns `FRESH` (setup required), not `BROKEN` (repair required)
- **Benefit**: Fresh workspaces show "Initialize" prompt instead of confusing "Repair Environment" prompt
- **Updated**: UX messaging now clearly distinguishes between "needs setup" (FRESH) and "needs repair" (BROKEN) states

#### M4: Increase Initialization Timeout
- **Bug**: First-run initialization could time out prematurely (15s) during database creation on slower machines or when downloading LanceDB embedding models
- **Fix**: Increased timeout from 15 seconds to 60 seconds for first-run initialization
- **Benefit**: Slow first-run initializations complete successfully without false timeout failures

### User Experience Improvements
- **No-reload workflow**: Complete initialization from setup to ready state without any window reload
- **Clear messaging**: Distinct prompts for fresh workspaces ("Initialize") vs broken environments ("Repair")
- **Error transparency**: Initialization failures now show user-facing notifications with actionable guidance

## [0.4.6]

### Fixed - Plan 039: Initialization UX and Security Hardening

**User Experience and Security Release** - Resolves activation deadlock, improves initialization guidance, and implements security hardening from Plan 037 audit.

#### M1: Fix Activation Deadlock
- **Bug**: Extension activation could hang indefinitely when initialization failed, requiring VS Code restart
- **Root Cause**: Blocking `await vscode.window.showWarningMessage()` in failure path prevented `activate()` from returning
- **Fix**: Replaced blocking `await` with non-blocking `.then()` callback pattern, ensuring activation completes within 2 seconds

#### M2: Register `Flowbaby.initializeWorkspace` Command
- **New**: Added `Flowbaby.initializeWorkspace` command for workspace initialization
- **Change**: `Flowbaby.setupEnvironment` retained as backward-compatible alias
- **Benefit**: Consistent command naming within `Flowbaby.*` namespace

#### M3: Proactive Health Check
- **New**: `checkWorkspaceHealth()` method returns `FRESH | BROKEN | VALID` status
- **Change**: Activation flow now checks workspace health before attempting client initialization
- **Benefit**: Targeted UX guidance based on actual workspace state (fresh vs corrupted vs ready)
- **Added**: Migration marker validation (`.migration-in-progress` check) per architecture review R3

#### M4: Full Database Initialization
- **Verified**: `init.py` already performs complete database priming (SQLite, Kuzu, LanceDB) for fresh workspaces
- **No changes required**: Existing implementation meets acceptance criteria

#### M5: Remove `.env` API Key Support (Security - F2)
- **Breaking Change**: Removed workspace `.env` file API key loading
- **Migration**: Users must use `Flowbaby: Set API Key` command for secure SecretStorage
- **Rationale**: Plaintext API keys in `.env` files are credential exposure risk
- **Files Updated**: `flowbabyClient.ts`, `init.py`, `ingest.py`, `retrieve.py`, `list_memories.py`, `validate_memories.py`

#### M6: Audit Logging (Security - F7)
- **New**: `AuditLogger` class for security event tracking
- **Format**: JSON-lines structured logging to `.flowbaby/logs/audit.jsonl`
- **Events Logged**: API key changes, memory clear operations, environment initialization
- **Benefit**: Security audit trail for credential and data operations

#### M7: Safe Memory Clear with Soft-Delete (Security - F8)
- **Change**: `clearMemory()` now moves data to `.flowbaby/.trash/{timestamp}/` instead of permanent deletion
- **Benefit**: Recovery possible for accidentally cleared memories
- **New**: `purgeTrash()` method for permanent trash cleanup
- **Audit**: All clear operations logged via AuditLogger

#### M8: Version and Release Artifacts
- **Version**: 0.4.5 → 0.4.6
- **Changelog**: Updated with Plan 039 changes

### Breaking Changes
- **API Key Source**: Workspace `.env` files no longer used for API key resolution. Use `Flowbaby: Set API Key` command or set `LLM_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Security Improvements
- Credentials now stored in VS Code SecretStorage (encrypted)
- Security-relevant operations logged to audit trail
- Data deletion uses soft-delete with recovery option

## [0.4.5]

### Fixed - Plan 034: Initialization Bugs and Background Notification Issues

**Maintenance Release** - Resolves 3 critical bugs affecting new workspace initialization and background processing notifications.

#### Database Initialization for Fresh Workspaces
- **Bug**: Fresh workspaces threw `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: principals` during user registration
- **Root Cause**: Database table creation was implicitly part of `prune_system()`. Fresh workspaces (where pruning is skipped) never called table creation
- **Fix**: Explicitly call `create_db_and_tables()` from `cognee.infrastructure.databases.relational` in the fresh workspace initialization path

#### Lance Namespace Import Error
- **Bug**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'lance_namespace'` prevented vector engine loading
- **Root Cause**: The `lance-namespace==0.2.0` package on PyPI is broken/incomplete - missing the `lance_namespace` top-level module
- **Fix**: Pinned `lance-namespace==0.0.21` in `requirements.txt` (verified working version)

#### Background Notification False Positives
- **Bug**: "Flowbaby processing failed" notifications appeared despite successful ingestion in logs
- **Root Cause**: `ingest.py` wrote status stubs to `.cognee/background_ops/` (legacy path) while `BackgroundOperationManager.ts` looked for stubs in `.flowbaby/background_ops/`
- **Fix**: Updated `ingest.py` to write status stubs to `.flowbaby/background_ops/`

### Technical Notes
- All fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing workspaces
- Legacy `.cognee/background_ops` stubs will be ignored (no functional impact)
- No migration required from v0.4.4

## [0.4.4]

### Fixed - Plan 033: Complete Environment Variable Hotfix

**Hotfix** - Completes the v0.4.3 environment variable fix that missed `init.py`, preventing "still initializing" hang and `.cognee` folder creation.

#### Root Cause
v0.4.3 correctly fixed `ingest.py` and `retrieve.py` to set `SYSTEM_ROOT_DIRECTORY` and `DATA_ROOT_DIRECTORY` before importing Cognee SDK. However, **`init.py` was missed**, causing:
1. Creation of orphan `.cognee` folder in workspace root
2. Missing `.flowbaby/data` directory
3. "Flowbaby is still initializing..." hang on first activation
4. Retrieval failures ("no relevant memories found")

#### Fix Applied
- Set `SYSTEM_ROOT_DIRECTORY` and `DATA_ROOT_DIRECTORY` environment variables **before** `import cognee` in `init.py` (lines 178-215)
- Changed legacy `.cognee` directory creation to `.flowbaby` for marker files (line 263)
- Conducted bridge-wide import audit - all 8 scripts now follow the "env vars before import" invariant
- Fixed additional non-compliant scripts: `list_memories.py`, `validate_memories.py`, `recover_data.py`

#### Bridge-Wide Invariant (Documented)
All bridge entrypoints must now follow this sequence:
1. Compute `.flowbaby/system` and `.flowbaby/data` paths
2. Create directories with `Path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`
3. Set `os.environ['SYSTEM_ROOT_DIRECTORY']` and `os.environ['DATA_ROOT_DIRECTORY']`
4. **Only then** `import cognee`

This invariant is enforced because Cognee SDK uses `pydantic-settings` with `@lru_cache`, reading environment variables at import time.

#### Test Coverage Added
- `test_sets_env_vars_before_cognee_import` - verifies env var values
- `test_creates_flowbaby_dirs_not_cognee_dirs` - filesystem regression test
- `test_env_vars_contain_flowbaby_path` - path validation

## [0.4.3]

### Fixed - Hotfix: Cognee SDK Environment Variable Names

**Critical Hotfix** - Fixes storage directory misconfiguration causing `FileNotFoundError: Storage directory does not exist: '.cognee_data'`.

#### Root Cause
v0.4.2 used incorrect environment variable names (`COGNEE_SYSTEM_ROOT_DIRECTORY`, `COGNEE_DATA_ROOT_DIRECTORY`). The Cognee SDK's `BaseConfig` uses pydantic-settings which reads environment variables matching the exact field names—no `COGNEE_` prefix.

#### Fix Applied
- Changed `COGNEE_SYSTEM_ROOT_DIRECTORY` → `SYSTEM_ROOT_DIRECTORY` in `ingest.py` and `retrieve.py`
- Changed `COGNEE_DATA_ROOT_DIRECTORY` → `DATA_ROOT_DIRECTORY` in `ingest.py` and `retrieve.py`

#### Impact
- Background cognify operations now correctly use workspace-local `.flowbaby/` paths
- New data files appear in `.flowbaby/data/` instead of `~/.cognee_data`

## [0.4.2]

### Fixed - Plan 032: Activation and Background Processing Bugs

**Maintenance Release** - Resolves 6 bugs affecting extension activation, database generation, log rotation, and branding consistency.

#### Chat Agent Registration (#1)
- **Bug**: @flowbaby chat participant only appeared after extension fully initialized, requiring user to reload window
- **Root Cause**: `registerFlowbabyParticipant()` was called inside `if (initialized)` block, delaying UI registration
- **Fix**: Moved chat participant registration BEFORE `flowbabyClient.initialize()` with graceful degradation - handler shows "⏳ Flowbaby is still initializing..." message while backend completes setup

#### Cognee SDK Storage Pathing (#2)
- **Bug**: Database files created in `~/.cognee_data` instead of workspace-local `.flowbaby/data`
- **Root Cause**: Cognee SDK may cache paths on import; environment variables were set after import in bridge scripts
- **Fix**: 
  - Added explicit `.flowbaby/data` directory creation in `init.py` alongside `.flowbaby/system`
  - Restructured `ingest.py` and `retrieve.py` to set `COGNEE_SYSTEM_ROOT_DIRECTORY` and `COGNEE_DATA_ROOT_DIRECTORY` environment variables BEFORE `import cognee`
  - Safety check `workspace_has_data()` already existed and continues to prevent accidental data loss

#### Log Rotation Fix (#3)
- **Bug**: Python RotatingFileHandler writing to `.log.1` instead of `.log` after rotation
- **Root Cause**: TypeScript `BackgroundOperationManager` was opening log file descriptor and passing it to spawned Python process; TypeScript holding the fd prevented Python from rotating properly
- **Fix**: Removed `logFd` file descriptor passing in `spawnCognifyProcess()`. Python `bridge_logger.py` now handles all log rotation independently using its own RotatingFileHandler

#### Branding Consistency (#4)
- **Bug**: Toast notifications showed "⚠️ Cognify failed" and "✅ Cognify finished" instead of Flowbaby branding
- **Fix**: Updated all user-facing toast messages in `BackgroundOperationManager.ts`:
  - `'✅ Cognify finished'` → `'✅ Flowbaby processing finished'`
  - `'⚠️ Cognify failed'` → `'⚠️ Flowbaby processing failed'`
  - Updated corresponding internal log messages for consistency

### Technical Notes
- Plan 032 follows architectural guidance from Plan 031 and maintains backward compatibility
- No migration required from v0.4.1; users can update seamlessly
- Log file location unchanged: `.flowbaby/logs/flowbaby.log`

## [0.4.1]

### Fixed - Plan 031: Background API Key and Logging Consolidation

**Critical Hotfix** - Resolves v0.4.0 regressions affecting background ingestion and logging.

#### Background Ingestion API Key Fix
- **Root Cause**: `BackgroundOperationManager.spawnCognifyProcess()` was not injecting `LLM_API_KEY` from SecretStorage into the spawned process environment, causing `MISSING_API_KEY` errors for users who relied on the "Flowbaby: Set API Key" command.
- **Fix**: Added `resolveApiKey()` and `getLLMEnvironment()` methods to `BackgroundOperationManager`, mirroring the working implementation in `FlowbabyClient`. These methods now properly inject API keys from:
  1. Workspace `.env` file (highest priority)
  2. VS Code SecretStorage (`flowbaby.llmApiKey`)
  3. System environment variable (`LLM_API_KEY`)
- **Scope**: Applies to `spawnCognifyProcess()` (background cognify) and `runPythonJson()` (add-only retry).

#### Logging Consolidation
- **Unified Log File**: All Python bridge logs now write to `.flowbaby/logs/flowbaby.log` (was split between `bridge.log` and `ingest.log`).
- **Updated Logger**: `bridge_logger.py` updated to use `.flowbaby/logs/flowbaby.log` path and `flowbaby.*` logger names.
- **View Logs Action**: "View Logs" notification action now opens the consolidated log file.

#### Test Infrastructure
- **rdflib Dependency**: Added early detection for missing `rdflib` library in test environment with actionable error message in `conftest.py`.
- **Updated Tests**: `test_logging_overhaul.py` updated to use new log paths.

#### Documentation
- **README.md**: Fixed Windows path example to use `.flowbaby` instead of `.cognee`.
- **extension.ts**: Fixed incorrect pip install instruction - changed "pip install flowbaby" to "pip install cognee" (flowbaby is the VS Code extension name, not a Python package).

## [0.4.0]

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

This release rebrands the extension from "RecallFlow Chat Memory" to "Flowbaby" with significant breaking changes:

#### Branding Changes

- **Action Required**: Update your `.agent.md` files

#### Workspace Storage Changes
- All extension data now stored under `.flowbaby/` (was `.cognee/`, `.cognee_data/`, `.cognee_system/`)
- **Action Required**: Re-set your API key via `Flowbaby: Set API Key` command
- **Note**: Previous workspace memories are not migrated

#### Logging Consolidation
- Single log file: `.flowbaby/logs/flowbaby.log`
- Removed redundant `ingest.log`

### Migration Steps

4. Update any custom keybindings from `cognee.*` to `Flowbaby.*`
5. Update any agent definitions to use new tool names

## [0.3.17]

### Fixed - Plan 028: Post-v0.3.16 Bug Fixes and Developer Experience

- **Duplicate Output Channels**: Fixed issue where multiple "Flowbaby Memory" output channels were created. Implemented singleton pattern in `outputChannels.ts`.
- **Status Bar Unclickable**: Fixed status bar command registration timing issue. Commands are now registered early in activation with try/catch error handling.

### Added

- **Debug Logging Channel**: New opt-in debug output channel for troubleshooting. Enable via `Flowbaby.debugLogging` setting and use "Flowbaby: Show Debug Logs" command.
- **Isolated Python Environment**: venv moved from `.venv` to `.flowbaby/venv` to prevent conflicts with project virtual environments and Python language servers (e.g., Pylance/Jedi).
- **venv Conflict Detection**: When an existing `.venv` is detected, users are offered a choice between the isolated `.flowbaby/venv` (recommended) or using the existing `.venv` (advanced).
- **Global API Key via SecretStorage**: New "Flowbaby: Set API Key" command stores API keys securely via VS Code's SecretStorage API. Keys are shared across all workspaces.
- **API Key Priority**: Resolution order is now workspace `.env` > SecretStorage (global) > system environment variable.
- **Global LLM Configuration**: New settings `Flowbaby.llm.provider`, `Flowbaby.llm.model`, and `Flowbaby.llm.endpoint` for configuring LLM providers without per-workspace `.env` files.
- **Clear API Key Command**: New "Flowbaby: Clear API Key" command to remove stored SecretStorage key.

### Changed

- **Python Interpreter Detection**: Priority order updated to: explicit setting > `.flowbaby/venv` > `.venv` (legacy) > system python3.
- **Documentation**: Updated README and SETUP docs to reflect new setup flow, removed global pip install requirement, documented new features and troubleshooting steps.

## [0.3.16]

### Fixed - Plan 027: Migration Marker Data Loss Bug

- **Critical P0 Bug Fix**: Fixed a bug that caused 96% data loss when the cognee Python package was reinstalled. The migration marker was being written to the volatile venv location instead of the workspace-local `.flowbaby/system/` directory.
- **Root Cause**: `get_relational_config()` was called BEFORE `cognee.config.system_root_directory()`, returning the venv path instead of the configured workspace path.
- **Reordered Initialization**: Workspace directories are now configured FIRST, and the marker path is derived directly from the workspace path (never querying SDK config).
- **Safety Check**: Added `workspace_has_data()` function that refuses to prune if existing LanceDB or Kuzu data is detected, preventing accidental data loss.
- **Prominent Warnings**: Added visual warning separators (`====`) before any prune operation to make the action obvious in logs.
- **Data Integrity Health Check**: Added `get_data_integrity_status()` function to compare SQLite vs LanceDB counts for consistency monitoring.

### Testing
- Added `extension/bridge/tests/test_init_migration.py` with 15 test cases covering marker location, safety checks, and integrity status.

## [0.3.15]

### Fixed - Plan 026: Path Canonicalization and Retrieval Scoring

- **Path Canonicalization**: All 5 Python bridge scripts (`ingest.py`, `retrieve.py`, `init.py`, `list_memories.py`, `validate_memories.py`) now strictly canonicalize workspace paths at entry. This fixes `IngestionError 415` when opening workspaces with relative paths (e.g., `code .`).
- **UI Initialization**: Fixed a "chicken-and-egg" bug where the Status Bar and Setup Service were only created *after* successful initialization. They now appear immediately, ensuring the "Setup Required" indicator is visible in fresh workspaces.
- **Synthesized Answer Scoring**: Fixed confusing display of synthesized graph answers (which have a raw score of 0.00). The bridge now detects this sentinel, assigns a high ranking score, and attaches a `confidenceLabel="synthesized_high"` metadata field.
- **Qualitative UI Labels**: The UI now displays "High relevance (synthesized)" for graph completions instead of overloading the numeric score or showing 0.00.

## [0.3.14]

### Added - Plan 025: Simplified Python Environment Setup

- **Managed Python Environment**: Flowbaby now automatically creates and manages a dedicated `.venv` virtual environment in your workspace, eliminating manual setup steps.
- **One-Click Setup**: New "Initialize Workspace" command handles Python version checks (3.8+), virtual environment creation, and dependency installation in a single click.
- **Status Bar Indicator**: Added a status bar item showing environment health (Ready, Setup Required, Refreshing, Error) with quick access to repair actions.
- **Dependency Management**: New "Refresh Dependencies" command safely updates the bridge environment, coordinating with background operations to prevent conflicts.
- **Smart Precedence**: Automatically detects existing `.venv` or configured Python paths, but prioritizes the managed environment for reliability.
- **Enhanced Walkthrough**: The "Get Started" walkthrough now guides users through the automated setup process with context-aware completion steps.
- **Robust Metadata**: Tracks environment state and version compatibility in `.flowbaby/bridge-env.json` to ensure stability across updates.

## [0.3.13]

### Added - Plan 024: Configurable Search Parameters

- **Configurable Search Depth (`searchTopK`)**: Added new `Flowbaby.searchTopK` setting (default 10, range 1–100) to control how many candidates the Flowbaby search engine returns before ranking.
- **Higher Context Token Budget**: Increased `Flowbaby.maxContextTokens` default from 2000 to 32000 and maximum to 100000 to better support large-context models.
- **Bridge Safeguards**: `retrieve.py` now clamps `max_tokens` into the [100, 100000] window, normalizes `top_k` so it is never lower than `max_results`, and hard-clamps `top_k` to 100 to prevent runaway latency.
- **Normalization & Logging**: When a user-provided `top_k` is raised to meet `max_results` or clamped to the ceiling, the bridge logs a structured warning with both requested and effective values for easier debugging.
- **Client Logging & Truncation**: `CogneeClient` logs the configured `searchTopK` value on each retrieval and passes it through to the bridge. Output-channel payloads remain truncated to keep the VS Code UI responsive.

## [0.3.12]

### Fixed - Plan 022: Retrieval Filtering and Truncation

- **Retrieval Filtering**: Fixed aggressive filtering of "no_relevant_context" responses. The bridge now uses an exact match check instead of a substring match, preventing valid answers that quote the sentinel value from being discarded.
- **Client Truncation**: Increased `CogneeClient` stdout buffer from 2KB to 1MB. This fixes JSON parse errors when retrieval results exceed the default buffer size.
- **Error Logging**: Improved error reporting to capture and log both stdout and stderr when JSON parsing fails, aiding in debugging bridge issues.
- **Telemetry**: Added `filtered_count` to retrieval telemetry to track how many items are filtered by the bridge.

## [0.3.11]

### Fixed - Plan 021: Retrieval Display for Synthesized Answers

- **Retrieval Display Bug**: Fixed a regression where synthesized answers (score 0.0) were silently filtered out by the client-side safety check.
- **Sentinel-Aware Filter**: Updated `CogneeContextProvider` to explicitly allow results with `score === 0.0` (sentinel for synthesized answers) while maintaining strict filtering for low-confidence noise (e.g., 0.001 - 0.009).
- **Logging**: Added debug logging to indicate when synthesized answers are included in retrieval results.

## [0.3.10]

### Fixed - Plan 023: Retrieval Scoring Hotfix

- **Retrieval Regression**: Fixed an issue where valid `GRAPH_COMPLETION` answers (synthesized strings) were discarded because they lacked a semantic score and hit the strict `score <= 0.01` filter introduced in v0.3.9.
- **Logic Update**: `retrieve.py` now bypasses the strict score filter for synthesized answers (which default to score 0.0) while maintaining the filter for `NO_RELEVANT_CONTEXT` responses.

## [0.3.9]

### Added - Plan 021: Logging Infrastructure Overhaul

**Structured Bridge Logging** - Python bridge scripts now use a shared logging utility that emits structured JSON-lines to both the VS Code Output Channel and a persistent workspace log file (`.flowbaby/logs/bridge.log`).
- **Rotating Log File**: `bridge_logger.py` writes untruncated diagnostics with 5MB rotation (3 backups) so retrieval and ingestion history is never lost.
- **Detailed Retrieval Telemetry**: `retrieve.py` logs candidate lists, semantic scores, recency/status multipliers, filtering reasons, and final selections for each query.
- **Ingestion Metrics**: `ingest.py` reports character counts and stage durations, making performance bottlenecks obvious.
- **Consistent Formatting**: All bridge scripts (`init.py`, `validate_memories.py`, `list_memories.py`) now produce structured JSON logs for easier parsing and UI rendering.
- **VS Code Output Contract**: Stderr handler keeps Output Channel entries lightweight (~2KB) while retaining full fidelity in file logs.

### Testing
- Added `extension/bridge/tests/test_logging_overhaul.py` covering log file creation, ingestion metrics, retrieval scoring telemetry, and stderr formatting.

## [0.3.8]

### Added - Plan 021: Memory Visibility and Trust

**Zero-Hallucination Retrieval** - Implemented strict filtering to prevent irrelevant memories from polluting context:
- **Strict Score Threshold**: Retrieval results with distance scores > 0.01 are now filtered out by default.
- **Explicit "No Context" Signal**: Bridge now returns `NO_RELEVANT_CONTEXT` signal when no memories meet the threshold, preventing hallucinated "matches".
- **Validation Tools**: New commands for inspecting memory state:
  - `Flowbaby: Validate Memories` - Runs integrity checks on stored memories.
  - `Flowbaby: List Memories` - Dumps raw memory content for debugging.

**Fixed**:
- **Integration Test Stability**: Fixed path resolution errors in integration tests by correctly injecting `extensionPath` into the mock context. All 149 tests now pass.
- **Branding Cleanup**: Removed "formerly Cognee" references from extension description and UI strings for a cleaner "Flowbaby" identity.

## [0.3.7]

### Fixed - Plan 019: Flowbaby Rebranding Gaps

- **Publisher Identity**: Marketplace publisher ID now set to `flowbaby` with author updated to "Flowbaby Team" so the extension no longer appears under the legacy Cognee brand.
- **Language Model Tools**: Renamed tool identifiers and reference names to `flowbaby_storeMemory` / `flowbaby_retrieveMemory` so Configure Tools, chat autocomplete, and `.agent.md` definitions all reflect the Flowbaby brand.
- **Documentation Alignment**: `README.md` and `AGENT_INTEGRATION.md` now show the correct tool names and usage examples, preventing confusion for agent developers.
- **Test Coverage**: Integration tests updated to ensure the new tool identifiers register correctly with GitHub Copilot chat and that UI instructions stay in sync.

## [0.3.6]

### Added - Plan 019: Retrieval Fabrication and Silent Failure Fix

**Rebranding to Flowbaby** - The extension has been renamed to "Flowbaby" to better reflect its purpose as a memory and recall layer for AI agents.
- **User-Facing Changes**:
  - Extension name: "Flowbaby Chat Memory"
  - Commands: `Flowbaby: Capture to Memory`, `Flowbaby: Toggle Memory`, etc.
  - Output Channel: "Flowbaby Agent Activity"
  - Chat Participant: `@flowbaby-memory`
  - Tools: "Store Memory in Flowbaby", "Retrieve Flowbaby Memory"
  - **Tool Renaming**: `flowbaby_storeMemory` → `flowbaby_storeMemory`, `flowbaby_retrieveMemory` → `flowbaby_retrieveMemory`
- **Backward Compatibility**:
  - Internal configuration keys (`Flowbaby.*`) remain unchanged
  - File paths (`.flowbaby/`) remain unchanged
  - Python package (`cognee`) remains unchanged

**Fixes & Improvements**:

- **Retrieval Fabrication Fix**: Changed default semantic score for unscored results from 0.7 to 0.0. This prevents empty or irrelevant results from appearing with artificially high confidence scores.
- **Silent Failure Detection**:
  - Implemented log rotation for background processes (`.flowbaby/logs/ingest.log`)
  - Redirected `stdout`/`stderr` of background processes to log files to capture crashes
  - Added "zombie" detection for processes that exit without writing a status stub
- **Proactive Prevention**: Enforced 100k character limit on ingestion payloads to prevent bridge crashes and memory exhaustion.
- **UX Enhancements**: Added timestamps to `Flowbaby: Show Background Operations` quick pick items for better visibility.

## [0.3.5]

### Added - Plan 018: Metadata Infrastructure and Ranking

**Intelligent Ranking & Filtering** - Retrieval now prioritizes memories based on recency and status:
- **Recency-Aware Ranking**: New exponential decay algorithm prioritizes fresh memories. Configurable via `Flowbaby.ranking.halfLifeDays` (default: 7 days).
- **Status Filtering**: Memories can be marked as `Active`, `Superseded`, or `DecisionRecord`.
  - `Superseded` memories are hidden by default to reduce noise.
  - `DecisionRecord` memories receive a relevance boost.
- **Metadata-Rich Storage**: Summaries now embed structured metadata (topicId, status, timestamps) directly in the text, enabling robust tracking even without graph metadata support.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Enriched Text Fallback**: Implemented "Enriched Text" pattern to store metadata within summary text, bypassing Cognee 0.3.4 DataPoint limitations.
- **Migration Script**: New `migrate_summaries.py` script automatically upgrades legacy memories to the new schema.
- **Safe Migration**: Uses file locking (`.flowbaby/maintenance.lock`) to pause background operations during migration.
- **Updated Tool Definitions**: `flowbaby_storeMemory` and `flowbaby_retrieveMemory` tools updated with clearer descriptions and privacy guarantees ("Data stays in this workspace").

### Fixed
- **Ranking Quality**: Addressed issue where old, less relevant memories cluttered retrieval results.
- **Status Visibility**: Superseded plans and decisions no longer confuse agents.

## [0.3.4]

### Release

This release packages the async cognify() optimization (Plan 017) with no functional changes from v0.3.3. Version bumped to v0.3.4 for clean release tracking.

All features, improvements, and technical details remain as documented in v0.3.3 below. This is a packaging-only release to formalize the deployment.

## [0.3.3]

### Added - Plan 017: Async cognify() Optimization

**Universal Async Memory Ingestion** - ALL ingestion flows (agent tools, manual capture, headless commands) now return in <10 seconds:

- **Staged Messaging**: Every ingestion surface shows: "Memory staged – processing will finish in ~1–2 minutes. You'll get a notification when it's done."
- **Background Processing**: Knowledge graph construction (`cognee.cognify()`) runs in detached subprocess while agents continue working
- **Completion Notifications**: 
  - Success (info): "✅ Cognify finished" with workspace name, summary digest, elapsed time, entity count, "View Status" action
  - Failure (warning): "⚠️ Cognify failed" with workspace name, summary digest, remediation guidance, "Retry"/"View Logs" actions
- **Independent Throttling**: Success and failure notifications throttled separately (≤1 per 5 min per workspace per outcome type)
- **Background Status Command**: New `cognee.backgroundStatus` command shows all in-flight/completed operations with quick-pick UI

**Technical Implementation**:

- Split `ingest.py` into 3 modes: `--mode sync` (diagnostic), `--mode add-only` (fast staging <10s), `--mode cognify-only` (background graph construction)
- BackgroundOperationManager service with:
  - Dual-ledger persistence (`.flowbaby/background_ops.json` + VS Code globalState)
  - Concurrency limits: max 2 concurrent + FIFO queue of 3 pending operations
  - Detached subprocess spawning with PID tracking
  - Activation reconciliation (reattach live PIDs, mark stale entries `unknown`)
  - Deactivation cleanup (SIGTERM with 5s grace + SIGKILL)
  - Atomic status stub writes prevent corruption on crashes
- Updated client methods: `ingestSummaryAsync()` and `ingestAsync()` for summary and conversation ingestion
- Comprehensive bridge test suite (15+ tests) covering all modes, error handling, backward compatibility

**Performance Impact**:

- Agent blocking time: **73s → <10s (86% reduction)**
- Manual capture blocking time: **73s → <10s (86% reduction)**
- Background processing: 60-90s (unchanged, runs asynchronously)
- **Result**: Agents can store 3 memories in 30s instead of 219s

**User Experience Changes**:

- Manual capture (`Ctrl+Alt+C`) now shows staged toast instead of blocking
- Agent tools (`#cogneeStoreSummary`) return immediately with operationId
- All users receive completion notification when background processing finishes
- Output channel shows full audit trail: `[BACKGROUND]` markers for start/success, `[ERROR]` for failures

**Backward Compatibility**:

- Sync mode (`--mode sync`) preserves legacy behavior for diagnostic/test use
- Conversation mode (positional args) continues to work with sync mode
- All existing tests pass unchanged

### Fixed - Plan 016.1: Tool Lifecycle and Bridge Timeouts Hotfix

**Bug Fixes**:

- **Tool Lifecycle UI Desync**: Fixed issue where Configure Tools dialog showed stale enablement state when toggling tools on/off. Tools now register unconditionally at extension activation; VS Code's Configure Tools UI is the sole authorization mechanism (no redundant workspace setting).
- **Bridge Timeout Opacity**: Added comprehensive diagnostic logging to Python bridge scripts (ingest.py, retrieve.py) with `[PROGRESS]`, `[WARNING]`, and `[ERROR]` markers. Users now see step-by-step progress in Output channel when bridge operations are slow or fail.
- **Redundant Authorization**: Removed `Flowbaby.agentAccess.*` workspace settings entirely. Simplified authorization model: users enable/disable tools via Configure Tools UI only.

**Breaking Changes**:

- Removed settings: `Flowbaby.agentAccess.enabled`, `Flowbaby.agentAccess.maxResultsDefault`, `Flowbaby.agentAccess.maxTokensDefault`, `Flowbaby.agentAccess.maxConcurrentRequests`, `Flowbaby.agentAccess.rateLimitPerMinute`
- Status bar "Cognee Agent Access" indicator removed (Configure Tools dialog provides feedback)
- Error code `ACCESS_DISABLED` no longer returned (tools always registered)

**Technical Details**:

- Bridge scripts emit structured error payloads with error codes: `LLM_API_ERROR`, `COGNEE_SDK_ERROR`, `PYTHON_ENV_ERROR`, `ONTOLOGY_LOAD_ERROR`
- TypeScript client (cogneeClient.ts) parses stderr for diagnostic markers and surfaces at appropriate log levels (INFO/ERROR/WARN)
- Fixed sys module import shadowing bug in retrieve.py
- Test suite updated to reflect new authorization model

**User Impact**:

- Simpler authorization: single source of truth (Configure Tools)
- Better debugging: diagnostic logs visible in Output > "Flowbaby" channel
- Faster resolution of bridge issues: progress markers identify exactly where operations block

## [0.3.0]

### Added - Plan 014: Structured Conversation Summaries

- **Conversation Summary Generation**: Create structured summaries via `@flowbaby summarize this conversation`
  - Adjustable turn count scope (default: last 15 turns)
  - Interactive scope adjustment before generation
  - LLM-powered summary extraction with Plan 014 schema
  - User confirmation required before storage

## [0.2.3]

### Fixed

- Display truncation in chat participant - users can now see full retrieved memory content (up to 2000 chars)
- Query logging truncation increased from 50 to 200+ characters for better debugging
- Ingestion timeout increased from 30s to 120s to reduce false-positive failures
- Error messages now distinguish timeout (may still succeed) from true ingestion failure
- Added comprehensive ingestion performance metrics (Python-side duration, step-level timing)
- Added process exit vs timeout logging for diagnosing bridge-level latency

### Improved

- Transparent memory display with character count indicators aligns with discoverability goals (Epic 0.2.2.3)
- Clear truncation indication when memories exceed 2000 chars (shows "showing X of Y chars")
- Query length now shown in debug logs when queries exceed 200 chars
- Ingestion timeout errors now explain background processing may still succeed
- Extension logs include both Node-side and Python-side duration metrics for correlation
- Step-level metrics (load_env, init_cognee, config_llm, dataset_ontology, add, cognify) enable bottleneck identification

## [0.2.2]

### Fixed

- Display truncation in chat participant - users can now see full retrieved memory content (up to 2000 chars)
- Query logging truncation increased from 50 to 200+ characters for better debugging

### Improved

- Transparent memory display with character count indicators aligns with discoverability goals (Epic 0.2.2.3)
- Clear truncation indication when memories exceed 2000 chars (shows "showing X of Y chars")
- Query length now shown in debug logs when queries exceed 200 chars

## [0.2.1]

### Breaking Changes

- **Environment**: `LLM_API_KEY` is now required in workspace `.env`. Previously supported `OPENAI_API_KEY` fallback removed to align with Cognee 0.4.0 conventions.

### Fixed

- Ingestion failures and 30s timeouts caused by Cognee using site-packages storage instead of workspace-local directories
- Silent parameter fallback code that masked configuration errors
- File-not-found errors during ingestion due to cross-context storage mismatches

### Changed

- All Cognee system and data directories now scoped to workspace (`.flowbaby/system/`, `.flowbaby/data/`)
- Removed fallback parameter retries; signature mismatches now surface as clear errors
- Enhanced error logging with structured details (exception type, parameters, context)

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- **Debug Configuration**: VS Code launch.json for F5 Extension Development Host debugging
- **Visible Build Logging**: esbuild now shows compilation progress and errors (logLevel: 'info')
- **Developer Documentation**: Enhanced SETUP.md and README.md with debugging workflow and troubleshooting guidance

### Fixed

- **Extension Activation Failure**: Missing .vscode/launch.json prevented Extension Development Host from loading the extension
- **Silent Build Errors**: Build failures were hidden with logLevel: 'silent', now visible for rapid debugging

### Implementation 008 Features (from v0.1.0 foundation)

#### Added

- **Keyboard Shortcut Capture (Ctrl+Alt+C / Cmd+Alt+C)**: Selective conversation capture via keyboard shortcut + input box workflow
- **@flowbaby Chat Participant**: Explicit memory-augmented chat participant for context retrieval and informed responses
- **Command Palette Capture**: Alternative capture method via "Cognee: Capture to Memory" command
- **Toggle Memory Command**: Quick on/off toggle via "Cognee: Toggle Memory" command
- **Clear Memory Command**: Delete workspace memory via "Cognee: Clear Workspace Memory" command (with confirmation)
- **OWL/Turtle Ontology**: Chat-specific ontology file (`ontology.ttl`) with 8 classes and 12 object properties for grounded entity extraction
- **Conversational Ingestion Format**: Simplified natural prose format for better LLM extraction quality
- **Step 6 Feedback Loop (Experimental)**: Optional automatic capture of @flowbaby conversations (disabled by default due to Cognee 0.4.0 bug)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Retrieval failures show warning but participant continues without context
- **Configuration Setting**: `Flowbaby.autoIngestConversations` for experimental feedback loop control

### Changed

- **User Workflow**: Shifted from automatic global capture to selective, user-controlled keyboard shortcut capture
- **Participant Model**: `@flowbaby` requires explicit invocation; no passive injection into other participants
- **Ontology Integration**: Updated `ingest.py` to use `ontology_file_path` parameter with RDFLib validation and graceful fallback
- **Ingestion Format**: Changed from bracketed metadata format to conversational prose for improved extraction

### Improved

- **Automatic Python Interpreter Detection**: Extension now auto-detects workspace `.venv` virtual environment, eliminating need for manual `Flowbaby.pythonPath` configuration in most cases
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Python errors (missing packages, API key issues) now visible in Output Channel with actionable troubleshooting hints
- **Workspace-Relative Execution**: Bridge scripts run from workspace context for reliable path resolution
- **Context Display**: Retrieved memories formatted with clear markdown previews ("📚 Retrieved N memories")
- **Performance Logging**: Retrieval timing logged to Output Channel for monitoring (<1000ms P95 target)
- Error logs sanitize sensitive data (API keys, tokens) before display
- Configuration documentation clarifies when manual Python path setting is needed
- Structured error extraction from Python subprocess stdout
- Better diagnostics for missing dependencies and environment issues

### Fixed

- Generic "exit code 1" errors replaced with specific failure reasons
- Missing `cognee` package now clearly diagnosed instead of silent failure
- Python interpreter mismatch no longer requires manual configuration for standard `.venv` setups
- Keyboard shortcut comment typo in code (Ctrl+Shift+M → Ctrl+Alt+C)

### Known Issues

- **Cognee 0.4.0 File Hashing Bug**: Intermittent ingestion failures for repeated identical content affect Step 6 auto-ingestion; workaround via `Flowbaby.autoIngestConversations=false` (default)
- **Manual Capture Workflow**: Keyboard shortcut requires copy-paste; cannot extract message from chat UI directly (VS Code API limitation)
- **Explicit Participant Invocation**: Must type `@flowbaby`; cannot inject context into other participants (API limitation)

### Technical Implementation

- 6-step participant flow: retrieval → format display → augment prompt → generate response → capture conversation (conditional)
- RDFLib ontology parsing with graceful fallback to no-ontology mode
- Asynchronous fire-and-forget ingestion (non-blocking)
- Comprehensive integration test suite (27 passing tests)
- VS Code Chat API v1.105+ compatibility

- Output Channel logging for debugging and monitoring

### Technical Implementation

- Uses Cognee 0.3.4 with dataset-based logical isolation
- SHA1-hashed workspace identifiers for stable and unique dataset naming
- Global marker file pattern prevents data loss during concurrent initialization
- Stateless ontology configuration applied per ingestion operation
- TypeScript extension with Python subprocess bridge architecture
- esbuild-based compilation for optimized bundle size

### Known Limitations

- Requires workspace folder (doesn't work in single-file mode)
- Currently captures conversations through Chat Participant API
- Python and Cognee must be installed separately (not bundled)
- First conversation in new workspace has no context (memory starts empty)
