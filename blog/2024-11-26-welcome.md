## What is Flowbaby?

AI coding assistants are incredibly powerful, but they have a fundamental limitation: they forget everything between sessions. Every new conversation starts from scratch, losing all the context, decisions, and implementation details from previous work.

Flowbaby solves this by providing a persistent knowledge graph that AI agents can read from and write to. When you complete significant work, the agent stores a memory. When you ask questions, the agent retrieves relevant past context.

## Getting Started

Check out our [Getting Started guide](/docs/getting-started) to install Flowbaby and start building your project's memory.
